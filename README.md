# 🚗 Tesla Stock Price Analysis using Python

This project is a final assignment completed during the **IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate** program. It focuses on analyzing Tesla's historical stock prices using Python and data visualization libraries in Jupyter Notebook.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To demonstrate proficiency in data wrangling, analysis, and visualization by:
- Importing and cleaning real-world financial data
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Creating meaningful visualizations
- Interpreting trends and business insights from the data

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `Final_Assignment_Tesla.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook containing all the code, visualizations, and analysis.
- *(Optional)* `data/` — If you add the dataset locally, place it here.
- *(Optional)* `images/` — Screenshots of plots or final visualizations.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3.x  
- **Pandas** — For data cleaning and manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** — For visualizations  
- **NumPy** — For numerical computations  
- **Jupyter Notebook** — For interactive analysis

## 📊 Key Features

- Visualization of Tesla stock prices over time
- Identification of trends, peaks, and patterns
